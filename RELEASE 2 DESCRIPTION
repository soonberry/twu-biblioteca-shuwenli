    List Movies - As a customer, I would like to see a list of available movies, so that I can browse for a movie that I might check-out. Movies have a name, year, director and movie rating (from 1-10 or unrated).
    Check-out Movie - As a customer, I would like to check out a movie from the library, so I can enjoy it at home.
    User Accounts - Login - As a librarian, I want to know who has checked out a book, so that I can hold them accountable for returning it. Users must now login using their library number (which is in the format xxx-xxxx) and a password in order to check-out and return books. User credentials are predefined, so registering new users is not part of this story.
    User Accounts - User information - As a customer, I want to be able to see my user information (name, email address and phone number), so that I know that the library can contact me. This option should only be available when the customer is logged in and should only display that customerâ€™s information.
